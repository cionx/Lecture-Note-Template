# Notes for Global Analysis I, WS 19/20

This repository contains my personal notes for the lecture course *Global Analysis I*, which will be held at the University of Bonn in the winter semester of 2019/20 by Dr. Koen van den Dungen.
A compiled version is available [here][1].

This repository is hosted on [GitLab][2] and mirrored on [GitHub][3].

For those who want to compile these notes themselves:
- Compiling is intended to be done with `lualatex` and a build script is provided for `latexmk`.
- The bibliography is done with the package `biblatex` and requires the `biber` backend.
- The package `gitinfo2` is used to display the date and hash of the last commit.
  This requires some (slight) setup and thus wonâ€™t work out-of-the-box.
  The document will still compile but the git information will be missing.
- The font `libertinus` is used for (nearly) everything.
  It is available on its [project page][4].
